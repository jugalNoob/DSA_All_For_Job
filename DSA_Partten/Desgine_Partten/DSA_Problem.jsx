Perfect follow-up 👍
You’re basically asking:

“After finishing these 30 DESIGN problems, which normal DSA problems should I solve to fully master them?”

Think of it as Design → Core DSA muscle → Advanced problems.

Below is a clear mapping so you know WHAT to practice and WHY.

🧠 Big Picture

Those 30 design problems are NOT isolated.
They are built from ~10 core DSA themes.

If you complete:

the 30 design problems

the DSA problems mapped below

👉 you’re interview-complete for 90% of product companies.

🧩 DESIGN → DSA PROBLEM MAPPING
1️⃣ LRU / LFU Cache
Core DSA you must master

DSA Topics

HashMap

Doubly Linked List

Practice These DSA Problems

Reverse Doubly Linked List

Delete node from DLL

Implement DLL from scratch

HashMap collision handling

Why

LRU/LFU = HashMap + DLL choreography

2️⃣ Min Stack / Max Stack / Stack with Middle
Core DSA

DSA Topics

Stack

Stack augmentation

Practice

Next Greater Element

Previous Smaller Element

Valid Parentheses

Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Why

These teach stack state maintenance, not just push/pop.

3️⃣ Time-Based Key Value Store / Snapshot Array
Core DSA

DSA Topics

Binary Search

Ordered data

Practice

Binary search on answers

Lower bound / Upper bound

Search in rotated sorted array

Find floor & ceil

Why

Time-based queries = binary search mastery.

4️⃣ Hit Counter / Rate Limiter / Moving Average
Core DSA

DSA Topics

Queue

Sliding Window

Practice

Sliding window max/min

Longest subarray with sum ≤ K

Fixed-size window problems

Circular queue problems

Why

Time-window aggregation is sliding window in disguise.

5️⃣ Median from Data Stream
Core DSA

DSA Topics

Heap (Priority Queue)

Practice

Kth largest element

Merge K sorted lists

Top K frequent elements

Heap sort

Why

Two-heaps pattern repeats everywhere.

6️⃣ Top K / K Closest / Feed Problems
Core DSA

DSA Topics

Heap

Sorting

Practice

Kth smallest element

Sort by frequency

Meeting rooms

Task scheduler

Why

Design feeds = K-way merge + heap

7️⃣ Trie / Autocomplete / Word Dictionary
Core DSA

DSA Topics

Trie

DFS

Practice

Implement Trie

Word search

Prefix matching

DFS on trees

Why

Trie is just a tree with character edges.

8️⃣ Twitter / Instagram / News Feed
Core DSA

DSA Topics

Heap

Graph basics

Practice

Merge sorted arrays

BFS/DFS basics

Topological sort (light)

K-way merge problems

Why

Feed = merging multiple sorted streams.

9️⃣ Randomized Set / All O(1) DS
Core DSA

DSA Topics

Array + HashMap trick

Index manipulation

Practice

Swap elements

Remove in O(1)

Fisher–Yates shuffle

Array index mapping

Why

O(1) delete = swap-with-last trick.

🔟 File System / Browser History / Parking Lot
Core DSA

DSA Topics

Tree

Object modeling

Practice

N-ary tree traversal

Path sum problems

Tree construction

Lowest Common Ancestor

Why

Hierarchical systems = trees.

📌 FINAL STUDY ORDER (IMPORTANT)
Phase 1 – Core DSA (must)
Array
Stack
Queue
HashMap
Heap
Linked List
Binary Search
Tree
Trie

Phase 2 – Design Problems (your 30)
LRU
LFU
Min Stack
Twitter
Trie
Rate Limiter
etc.

Phase 3 – Mapping Practice (THIS STEP)

Solve:

2–3 DSA problems per design category

🧠 Interviewer-Level Insight (Say This)

“Most design problems are compositions of a few core data structures. Once those are strong, design questions become predictable.”

That sentence alone shows senior-level thinking.

🔥 If you want next

I can:

✅ Create a LeetCode problem list mapped to each of the 30

✅ Build a 30-day design + DSA plan

✅ Do deep dive: LRU → DLL → HashMap → pitfalls

Just tell me what you want to attack next 💪
